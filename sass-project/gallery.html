		<h1>Black Holes!!!!!!!!!</h1>
		<p>
			NASA’s Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) has 
			captured a spectacular event: a supermassive black hole’s 
			gravity tugging on nearby X-ray light.
		</p>
		<p>
			In just a matter of days, the corona — a cloud of particles 
			traveling near the speed of light — fell in toward the black 
			hole. The observations are a powerful test of Einstein’s 
			theory of general relativity, which says gravity can bend 
			space-time, the fabric that shapes our universe, and the 
			light that travels through it.
		</p>
		<p>
			“The corona recently collapsed in toward the black hole, 
			with the result that the black hole’s intense gravity pulled 
			all the light down onto its surrounding disk, where material 
			is spiraling inward,” said coauthor Michael Parker from the 
			Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, United Kingdom, in a 
			press release.
		</p>
		<p>
			The supermassive black hole, known as Markarian 335, is 
			about 324 million light-years from Earth in the direction 
			of the constellation Pegasus. Such an extreme system squeezes 
			about 10 million times the mass of our Sun into a region only 
			30 times the diameter of the Sun. It spins so rapidly that 
			space and time are dragged around with it.
