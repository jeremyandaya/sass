		<h1>What is a Black Hole?</h1>
		<p>
			A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much 
			that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because 
			matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when 
			a star is dying.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They 
			are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find 
			black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very 
			close to black holes act differently than other stars.
		</p>
		<h2>How Big Are Black Holes?</h2>
		<p>
			Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest 
			black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are 
			very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount 
			of matter, or "stuff," in an object.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 
			20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar 
			mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes 
			have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have 
			found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at 
			its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way 
			galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million 
			suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million 
			Earths.
		</p>
		<h2>How Do Black Holes Form?</h2>
		<p>
			Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.
		</p>
		<p>
			Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in 
			upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova. A 
			supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as 
			the galaxy they are in.
		</p>
		<h2>If Black Holes Are "Black," How Do Scientists Know They Are There?</h2>
		<p>
			A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light 
			into the middle of the black hole. But scientists can see how the strong 
			gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole. Scientists can 
			study stars to find out if they are flying around, or orbiting, a black hole.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. 
			This kind of light can not be seen with human eyes. Scientists use satellites 
			and telescopes in space to see the high-energy light.
